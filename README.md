# Path finding algorithm

This github repository is about solving the problem of finding an optimal path for a randomly generated obstacles in a predefined grid. The code also has the capabilities to find path not only in linear directions but also in diagonal directions
The final result includes a visual representation of path given.

An example for the path given is:

This is for a situation where 35 obstacles are generated randomly.
